### [Project 1: Amazon Product Checker](https://github.com/jeetjain420/amazonproductchecker)
Created a python program that checks whether a product is available on Amazon or not. Uses requests to send an automatic email to the user if the product is available and also, the program keeps checking for the product after a specific time interval.
