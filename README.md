## Data Science Portfolio

### [Project 1: Amazon Product Checker](https://github.com/jeetjain420/amazonproductchecker)
Created a python program that checks whether a product is available on Amazon or not. Uses requests to send an automatic email to the user if the product is available and also, the program keeps checking for the product after a specific time interval.

### [Project 2: Telecom Churn Rate Prediction](https://github.com/jeetjain420/churn_rate_telecom)
Churn rate is the percentage of subscribers to a service that discontinue their subscription to that service in a given time period. We use Logistic Regression to predict the churn rate of a customer for the telecom idustry. The dataset contains information about the customers who left within the last month, services that each customer signed up for(phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection etc.), how long they have been a customer, customer account information(payment method,monthly charges, total charges) and demographic info about the customer such as gender, age range, if they have partners etc.

### [Project 3: Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction](https://github.com/jeetjain420/chronickidneydiseaseprediction)
Chronic Kidney Disease means that your kidneys are damaged and cannot filter the waste out of the urine efficiently. Machine Learning algorithms are used to train on the dataset which consists of blood and urine reports of a patient. The algorithms give the output of the risk of developing Chronic Kidney Disease in terms of 0 or 1. The early diagnosis of this disease is extremely important because the symptoms are only visible when the disease has developed into a lethal stage. Deployed the model into a [Web Application](http://ckd.pythonanywhere.com/).

### [Project 4: Reddit Wordcloud - Dataisbeautiful ](https://github.com/jeetjain420/reddit-wordcloud-dataisbeautiful/blob/master/reddit-wordcould-dataisbeautiful.ipynb)
Analysis of data retrived from the subreddit called r/Dataisbeautiful. A wordcloud is generated of the most frequent words used.

### [Project 5: Seizure Prediction](https://github.com/jeetjain420/seizure_prediction/blob/master/epilepsy_recognition.ipynb)
Epilepsy is a serious brain illness that is an endemic nuerological disorder all over the world. It is a clinical result that occurs with abnormal nuerological electrical discharging of the brain. Epileptic siezures represent the most common positive signs and symtoms of brain disturbance, and epilepsy is one of the most common primary brain disorders. Vascular causes, traumatic causes, infections and brain abscesses, bran tumors, nutritional deficiencies etc. are the leading cause for epilepsy. Dataset consists of EEG Recordings. EEG singals are separated into α, β, δ and θ spectral components and provide a wide range of frequency components. EEG spectrum contrains some characteristic waveforms that all primarily within four frequency bands.

### [Project 6: Automobile Data Visualisations](https://github.com/jeetjain420/automobile-datavisualisation/blob/master/AutomobileDataVisualisation.ipynb)
Visualising the fuel usage of different cars, based on car length, curb-weight, engine size, horsepower, city, and car price.

### [Project 7: Anti Suicide Bot](https://github.com/jeetjain420/suicidechatbot-datacleaning)
Creating an bot that detects the risk of a person committing suicide based on what messages he/she types. This can help prevent suicide or atleast lower the suicide rates by sending help that people who wish to commit suicide do not often seek for.

### [Project 8: Naval Ravikant Bot- Language Modelling](https://github.com/jeetjain420/twitter_naval_language_modelling)
Scraping the twitter data of Naval Ravikant bot to train a language modelling bot using a seuquential model, that predicts the next sequence of words in a sentence. 

### [Project 9: Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/jeetjain420/HeartDiseaseUCI)
Predicting the risk of heart disease of a pateint based on the dataset of blood samples as well as other important attributes like age, sex etc. This project was completed using R.

### [Project 10: Human Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/jeetjain420/human_emotion_recognition)
Recognizing human emotions from the audio samples, emotions are classified as : nuetral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised. Model is trained on voice samples of different people.
