### [Project 1: Amazon Product Checker](https://github.com/jeetjain420/amazonproductchecker)
Created a python program that checks whether a product is available on Amazon or not. Uses requests to send an automatic email to the user if the product is available and also, the program keeps checking for the product after a specific time interval.

### [Project 2: Telecom Churn Rate Prediction](https://github.com/jeetjain420/churn_rate_telecom)
Churn rate is the percentage of subscribers to a service that discontinue their subscription to that service in a given time period. We use Logistic Regression to predict the churn rate of a customer for the telecom idustry. The dataset contains information about the customers who left within the last month, services that each customer signed up for(phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection etc.), how long they have been a customer, customer account information(payment method,monthly charges, total charges) and demographic info about the customer such as gender, age range, if they have partners etc.
